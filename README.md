# Release notes: Version 2025.59.0

### Release Date: Feb 27, 2025 – 1:00 AM PST


## New Functionality

- FT-1206: Pre-authorize payments.
Pre-authorization allows funds to be held on a patient’s account prior to an Encounter, ensuring sufficient coverage for the expected costs. The pre-authorized amount is determined by the billing type and services added to the Encounter before the process is triggered. 

- An automation can be configured to handle specific actions upon the completion or cancellation of an Encounter - either charging the blocked funds or releasing them based on predefined settings. This ensures seamless financial workflows tailored to each Encounter’s outcome. More details found in Knowledge Base Content (https://welkinhealth.com/kb/pre-authorization/)

- Users also have advanced options at the Encounter level to manage pre-authorizations manually. This includes adjusting the pre-authorized amount, rescheduling or retrying a failed pre-authorization, canceling it, and either releasing or charging the held funds as needed.  This combined approach provides flexible, seamless financial workflows tailored to each Encounter’s outcome.

- FT-1191: Encounter: Amount Due.
We have replaced the “Outstanding Balance” value for Encounters with a new Amount Due value, precisely reflecting what the patient currently owes for that specific Encounter. This value factors in all prior payments, adjustments, and charges. 

- FT-1193: Encounter: Billing Statuses and Grid changes.
We have updated the Encounter grid (on the Encounters page) to help billing managers easily view and manage essential billing details in one place. New Encounter Billing Statuses were introduced to accurately reflect the patient’s current payment situation. These enhancements provide a comprehensive view of each Encounter’s billing information, streamlining the workflow for billing managers and enabling more effective payment tracking and management.

- FT-1195: Encounter: Renaming “Encounter Balance” to “Patient Payments”.
We have renamed the “Encounter Balance” field to “Patient Payments” to provide a clearer view of how much the patient has already paid toward the Encounter. The old Encounter Balance value has been deprecated, and all payment amounts made by the patient are now reflected under this updated Patient Payments value. This change ensures billing managers can quickly assess the patient’s contributions and track remaining financial responsibilities.

- FT-1316: Expanded Payment Method Support for Subscriptions.
We have introduced additional payment methods - Google Pay, Apple Pay, Link by Stripe, and Cash App - for subscription services in Welkin. When a Stripe payment link is sent to a patient, they choose their preferred method, pay, and are automatically charged according to the billing schedule. Once a payment method is used, it appears as the “Current Payment Method,” and any invoices generated for the subscription are tied to that method.

## Improvements and Bug Fixes
Additional items which have been released for customers due to specified improvements or bug fixes

- FT-1669: Changed the logic of selecting NPI for the Rendering Provider.
When creating claims in Candid, the user's NPI from user attributes will always be taken as the NPI for the Rendering Provider, regardless of the Billing Type (responsible party).

- FT-1594: Automation Audit Export API.
We have introduced a new security policy in the Designer under Data Export → Automation Audit, allowing you to export and monitor automation audits. A status filter (failure, success, conditions_check_failed) has been added exclusively to this new export endpoint, providing enhanced monitoring and alerting capabilities for automated workflows, including those that fail.

- FT-1595: API Access - Invoices endpoints.
The invoice API endpoints are now open, allowing read-only access to invoice data. For reference, visit the Postman Collection of Open Endpoints https://www.postman.com/welikan/public-welkinhealth-api/folder/9413ql0/invoices 

- FT-1662: Open API for downloading recognized calls.
Requests to view call information, as well as to download a recording of a recognized call are now open to the API client. To work with these requests, the client must have the “Voice Calls None Care Team” policy. For reference, visit the Postman Collection of Open Endpoints https://www.postman.com/welikan/public-welkinhealth-api/folder/dkc1vgh/calls

- FT-1695: Open API for downloading email and sms attachments.
Added ability to retrieve email and sms attachments via API. For reference, visit the Postman Collection of Open Endpoints for [emails](https://www.postman.com/welikan/public-welkinhealth-api/request/r87050q/download-email-attachment) and [sms](https://www.postman.com/welikan/public-welkinhealth-api/request/fwi9pbv/download-sms-attachment).

- FT-1254: Data Audit: Subscriptions.
New functionality has been added to log actions performed on subscriptions. Events categorized as "Subscription" will now appear in the Data Audit log. Actions such as creation, update, cancellation, etc. will be recorded for enhanced traceability.

- FT-1194: Enhanced Transaction View for Payment History in Invoices.
We have improved the payment history to provide a concise, expandable view of all transactions related to each payment. These grouped transactions - covering refunds, pre-authorizations, and cancellation fees - show their respective amounts, timestamps, and statuses in one place. 

- FT-1491 - Preview in Documents Center Increased to 100 Documents.
Removed the system limitation on the number of documents displayed in the pop-up when sending files.



# Release notes: Version 2024.58.0

### Release Date: Dec 18, 2024 – 1:00 AM PST


## New Functionality

- FT-1253: Subscriptions - Trial Period.
With this release, we have introduced the ability to set a trial period for subscriptions. In the Designer Portal, a new block has been added to the subscription template creation process, enabling users to define the number of days for the trial subscription period. In the Care Portal, the number of trial days can now be edited when creating a subscription.

- FT-1414: Data Audit: Discarded Assessment.
We have enhanced auditing capabilities for assessment management. A new Object Type "сdt: assessment(name of the assessment)" will be added with the event "cdt_deleted", which will show which cdts were deleted when discarding an assessment, providing greater transparency.

- FT-1221: Display the patient’s timezone during encounter scheduling.
We would like to present an improvement in the encounter creation drawer. This update improves the encounter scheduling process by displaying the patient’s time and time zone. The Patient field in the encounter creation drawer will show the patient’s local time and time zone. When the encounter time zone is changed, the patient’s time will automatically adjust accordingly. If the patient’s time zone is not specified, UTC will be displayed by default.

- FT-1222: Displaying a time zone for encounter start and end times.
This release will include an update for the encounter variables in Message Templates: startDateTime and endDateTime. The variables will display the time zone in addition to the date and time in the format “12-11-2024 9:00 am US/Pacific”. Notifications sent to patients will indicate the meeting time zone, minimizing misunderstandings. If a patient’s time zone is not specified, the encounter time will default to UTC.


## Improvements and Bug Fixes

- FT-1167: Improved focus for unfilled required fields in the patient’s profile.
User experience improvements when creating or editing a patient record. If a required field is left unfilled, clicking the Save button will automatically scroll to the 1st unfilled field, ensuring efficient data entry.

Powered by Stripe for payment processing, this integration helps streamline billing operations while boosting revenue and enhancing the overall patient experience. Please note that the Billing module needs to be enabled by the Welkin team for this feature to be available.

## Improvements and Bug Fixes

- FT-965: Receiving Complex Sig Data (Tapers / Titrations) from Dr. First.
It is now possible to receive complex sig data (tapers/titrations) from Dr. First and display it in Welkin. To enable this functionality, it is necessary to request activation from the Welkin account manager within Dr. First. Additionally, a new CDT and Data View must be created in Welkin to capture and display complex medication instructions.

- FT-996: Email Export API: missing attachments.
A problem with the incomplete export of attached files via the Export API has been resolved, ensuring consistent and reliable file export.




# Release notes: Version 2024.55.1

### Release Date: Sep 23, 2024 – 1:00 AM PST

## Improvements and Bug Fixes

- FT-1150: Bugfix for Security Policy page in the Designer

# Release notes: Version 2024.54.0

### Release Date: Aug 28, 2024 – 1:00 AM PST

## New Functionality


- FT-995: API - Bulk Export of Document Summary Data 
To streamline the process of exporting document summary data, we have introduced a new API endpoint that allows bulk export of this data.  With the new endpoint, you can retrieve all document summary records that have been updated recently, in a single request. This enhancement significantly reduces the number of API calls required, improving efficiency and reducing the time needed to access document summary data across multiple patients. For more details, please refer to the Welkin public collection in Postman.

- FT-1020: Automation for Generating and Sending Superbills
We have introduced a new feature that allows the automation, generation, and delivery of superbills to patients. This automation can be configured to send superbills via both regular and secure email, with the option to select a preferred email template. Organizations can set conditions based on Billing Type (e.g., Self-Pay) and use Encounter properties, such as Delivery Method or Billing Type, as triggers. Additionally, fields from Encounter Dispositions can be used to refine the automation criteria. If no invoice is generated for the Encounter, the automation will be failed, and an appropriate record will be logged in the automation audit within the Admin portal.

- FT-1078: Custom Logo Display in Care Portal
We have introduced a feature that allows you to customize the Care portal UI by displaying your own logo instead of the Welkin logo. This enhancement enables you to personalize the portal, aligning it with your branding and creating a more cohesive experience for users.

- FT-1073: Add Custom Fields to Patient's Top Info Section
You can now create custom patient profile fields and add them to the Top Info section in the Designer.


## Improvements and Bug Fixes

- FT-925: Improved Rich Text Handling for Variables with Quotes
We’ve enhanced the rich text editor in message templates to better support variables containing quotes. The editor accurately processes and displays these variables, ensuring consistent performance between plain text and rich text formats. 

- FT-1062: Enhanced Language Options in Designer, Care Portal, and Admin
We have expanded the language options to include German and Italian, along with French and Albanian. These languages are now available for selection in the primary and secondary language lists across the Designer, Admin, and Care portals.

- FT-1099: Updated Visual Design for Sign-In Page
We have updated the look and feel of the sign-in page, including a redesigned Welkin sign-in button. 

- FT-1113 Localization Support for Switzerland
We have added a new locale for Switzerland to accommodate region-specific formatting (time zone and date).

- FT-1021: Bugfix for Patient Deletion Error in Sandbox
We have resolved an issue that prevented users from deleting patients in the Sandbox environment.

- FT-1028: Bugfix for Missing Data in Admin Data Log
We have implemented a fix to ensure that events related to CDT updates are correctly recorded in the Data Audit log.

- CT-853: Expanded Automation Flexibility for Webhook Actions
We’ve enhanced the automation system to allow the creation of automations with webhook-only actions, even if the trigger might overlap with another automation. Previously, such configurations were blocked to prevent infinite loops, but this restriction has been lifted for webhook actions since they don’t create internal loops.
This update simplifies automation workflows and reduces the need for complex workarounds, giving users more flexibility while maintaining system integrity. 




# Release notes: Version 2024.53.1

### Release Date: Aug 20, 2024 – 1:00 AM PST

## New Functionality

- CT-675: Pre-authorization of Payments Instead of Charge
For customers needing pre-authorization of payments, we have introduced configurable parameters in the admin panel at the environment or account level. This allows for the following behaviors: If an Encounter is booked more than e.g. 48 hours before the appointment, the credit card is pre-authorized 48 hours before the appointment. If an Encounter is booked less than 48 hours before the appointment, pre-authorization occurs immediately. If an Encounter is canceled more than 48 hours before the appointment, no action is needed. If an Encounter is canceled less than 48 hours before the appointment, the patient is charged a fee, and the remaining amount is released. If an Encounter is marked as finalized, the pre-authorized amount is charged. 
These actions are managed via automation. If an Encounter is rescheduled, the rules apply to the new appointment time.


# Release notes: Version 2024.53.0

### Release Date: Aug 14, 2024 – 1:00 AM PST

## New Functionality

- FT-833: Dataviews Labeling Simplification
To simplify the labeling process for Data Views, labels are pre-filled at Add Form and Edit Form once they are set at View (Fields). This applies if Add Form and Edit Form are “On” and the labels are blank.  They can still be manually changed in each area as needed.

- FT-1016 (WS-4002): Patient - Searchable by Middle Name
As a Care portal user, you can now search for patients using their middle name to quickly and accurately find the correct patient record. The system allows users to search for patients by entering Middle Name only, or combined with First Name/Last Name.

- FT-994 (WS-2762): API - Adding Profile Export
We have added the ability to bulk export Profile data via the API, which is available under the /export/PDT_RECORD route. For more details, please refer to the Welkin public collection in Postman.

## Improvements and Bug Fixes

- FT-990: Move Configuration of Acuity UserID to Admin Panel
For customers using Acuity Enterprise integration, we have moved the configuration of the Acuity User ID field from User Attributes to the Admin panel. This change simplifies the configuration process.

- FT-504: Completed Assessments Sometimes Showing Blank Fields When Viewed
Fixed an issue where completed Assessments sometimes showed blank fields when Profiles were used.

- FT-701 (WS-3503): Save and Add Another in Profiles Get Stuck
Fixed an issue where the interface gets stuck when adding two or more answers to a question linked to Profiles.  Previously, after adding and saving multiple answers, the third addition would retain old information, requiring manual clearing before adding.

- FT-890: Availability Blocks UI Improvement
Added display of Encounter type icons and color coding of Encounter templates to make it easier to differentiate between different Encounter template availabilities.

- FT-975: Encounter Variables in Forms
Added support for new variables {{ENCOUNTER..startDateTime}}, {{ENCOUNTER..endDateTime}}, {{ENCOUNTER.*.location}} to Forms/Assessments. Previously, support for these variables was added to assessment PDFs.

- FT-1013 (WS-3985): Message in Dialog Box Is Off Frame for Messages with Long Links
Fixed the issue where messages in the dialog box would be off-frame if they contained long links.


# Release notes: Version 2024.52.0

### Release Date: July 31, 2024 – 1:00 AM PST

## New Functionality


- CT-805: Billing section
With the new release, Welkin is enhancing billing functionality. A Billing page can now be activated in the main layout in Care to provide a cross-patient view. It will include sub-pages for Invoices and Claims (for accounts with Candid Health integration activated). Sub-pages for Payments and Subscriptions will be added in the future. Additionally, a Billing page has been added to the patient layout, allowing similar information to be managed at the patient level.

- CT-813: Invoices 
We are introducing a new entity - Invoices. These can be used as a payment intent for a patient or as a receipt. In Designer, it is possible to upload a combination of templates for different patient and billing types to generate the appropriate Invoice PDFs. Invoices can be generated for Encounters and predefined services within the Encounter, or from the Billing page without reference to an Encounter, for services like paperwork. Future releases will automatically add Invoices to the patient Document Center.

- FT-900: Superbills
We are introducing Superbills, which can be sent to patients for reimbursement. A new section called “Superbill Template” has been added to Designer, allowing templates to be uploaded for generating Superbills. Superbills can be generated from the Encounter page and list all paid services within the Encounter. Future updates will include an automation for sending Superbills.

- FT-482 (WS-366): Variable Builder for Tables in Assessment PDF
We are adding new capabilities to build variables that will produce tables as outputs in assessment PDFs. This can be used to create documents requiring a table structure, such as listing medications. Variables can be configured to pull information from certain CDTs, filtering and sorting as needed.

## Improvements and Bug Fixes

- FT-885 (WS-3764, WS-3682): PII Information is Hidden in Tasks and Calendar
With this release, when a user views a Provider’s calendar who has patients to whom the user does not have access (due to Territories, Region, or Care Team restrictions), they will see “*****” instead of the first and last name, age, and gender in the calendar event blocks. Tasks for patients to whom users do not have access and for whom they are not the assignee will also be hidden. If the user is the assignee but does not have access to the patient, they will see “*****” instead of the first and last name.

- FT-919: External Profiles (e.g., MediSpan) Usable in Assessments
Previously, when a field attached to an external profile, such as our MediSpan medications, was used in an assessment, it could not search the external profile. It behaved like an internal profile, allowing selection only from items added via a data view. We have improved this functionality, and it will now enable searches within the external database.


# Release notes: Version 2024.51.0

### Release Date: July 15, 2024 – 1:00 AM PST

## New Functionality

- FT-832 (WS-3655): Improved Viewability of Encounter Titles
With this release, we’ve enhanced the readability of long Encounter titles on the list-drawer that appears when a user is creating an Encounter.

- FT-934 (WS-3391): Task Creation for Supervisor Co-Signature
Users can now create a Task from the signature interface to inform supervisors about Assessments pending their signatures.

## Improvements and Bug Fixes

- FT-932 (WS-3923): Default Value 0 Not Saved for Numeric Fields in Data Views
We fixed an issue where the value 0 was not being saved as the default for numeric fields in Data Views in Designer.

- FT-974 (WS-3916): Editing Usernames with Capital Letters
We resolved an issue where it was not possible to edit a user’s first and last name in the admin panel if the username contained capital letters.


# Release notes: Version 2024.50.0

### Release Date: July 3, 2024 – 1:00 AM PST (tentative)

## New Functionality

- FT-936 (WS-3601): Sorting for Data Views based on CDTs where Profiles are used
The sorting capabilities within Data Views has been improved to include CDTs that are connected to Profiles. An additional field ‘Profile Data Type Field’ is added in the Designer to allow this.

- FT-936 (WS-3391): Rich Text Editor for Text Area
A simple rich text editor can now be activated in Designer for Textarea CDTs. Text styling options such as bold, italic, bold italic, and checkbox styles will be available in the Care Portal when text is selected for CDTs with the rich text editor enabled. The added styles will be preserved in the assessment PDF.

- FT-720 (WS-3519): Encounter Variables Added to Assessment Templates
Support for new Encounter-related variables has been added to the Assessment Templates and will be available in the Assessment PDFs:
{{ENCOUNTER_START_DATETIME}}
{{ENCOUNTER_END_DATETIME}}
{{ENCOUNTER_LOCATION}} 
Please note that in the next release, this support will be extended to Assessments/Forms themselves, allowing this information to be viewed as read-only.




# Release notes: Version 2024.49.0

### Release Date: June 17, 2024 – 1:00 AM PST (tentative)

## New Functionality

- FT-912 (WS-3806): Display of Patient-related Contacts Completing Assessments
With this release, when Assessments are completed by patient-related contacts, the Assessment in Care will show the name of the patient-related contact instead of the patient’s name. Additionally, a “Contact” label will be displayed next to the name.

- FT-792: Synchronization of Users’ Availability With Acuity 
For customers with an enterprise plan in Acuity or those created under a Welkin parent account, the availability set for the Encounter templates will be synchronized with the corresponding appointment type in Acuity. This ensures that patients will see accurate availability for various Encounter types when self-scheduling.

- CT-852 (WS-3833): Sourcing NPI Field from CDTs (Candid Integration)
Prior to this release, the NPI field passed to Candid was taken from the user profile of the care member assigned to an Encounter. If the user did not have an NPI (e.g., RN, etc.), they had to enter the supervising provider’s NPI. With this release, the system will first check for the NPI field value in a CDT, and if it does not exist, it will then take the value from the user’s attribute.

- FT-795: Changes to the Font Used for Generating Assessment PDFs
With this release, we will change the default font used to generate Assessment PDFs. The reasoning behind this change is that the current font does not support the necessary styling for some documents, including handling Unicode symbols like checkboxes in different states, and more.


# Release notes: Version 2024.48.0

### Release Date: June 3, 2024 – 1:00 AM PST (tentative)

## New Functionality

- FT-835: Indication of Availability While Scheduling Encounters in Calendar
We have introduced an enhanced feature for scheduling Encounters that displays the availability of care team members in the calendar. When scheduling an Encounter, users can now see when specific users are available according to the selected Encounter template. This makes it easier to suggest suitable time slots to patients for different Encounter types, such as specific appointment types that are only available on certain days of the week. Available time slots for care team members will be displayed in green. This visibility enhancement is available in Day, Week, and Workday views.
In the next release, we will add synchronization of configured availability with Acuity for customers who hold an enterprise account or are maintained as a sub-account under Welkin's enterprise account in Acuity.

- FT-878: Patient Type field in Patient Profile
A new field has been added to the Patient Profile called "patient type," allowing to specify whether the patient record belongs to an adult, minor, or couple. This field can be added to the Top Info section, used as a variable within templates, and is exportable via API.

- FT-928: Change of Sisense domain to https://analytics.welkinhealth.com 
The Sisense domain will be updated from https://sisense.live.welkinhealth.com to https://analytics.welkinhealth.com as Welkin aims to better reflect our enhanced integration of analytics into the Welkin Health platform.

- FT-910 (WS-3759): Saving Phone Without Capabilities
With the new release, users can save primary and secondary phone numbers for patients without assigning any capabilities to them. Previously, saving a phone number required either Voice Call or SMS capabilities to be enabled. This enhancement now allows users to remove both Voice Call and SMS capabilities from a patient’s phone number and save the changes without the system automatically re-enabling these features. This update provides greater flexibility and accuracy in managing patient contact permissions.


# Release notes: Version 2024.47.0

### Release Date: May 22, 2024 – 1:00 AM PST (tentative)

## New Functionality

- CT-764: Provider Signature Capability in Care Portal 
Building on the recently introduced feature for patient e-sign consents, we are now expanding the functionality to allow providers to sign Assessment notes within the Care Portal. Users can now include new document types that require either one or two signatures - from a care team member and a supervisor, respectively - when creating forms in Designer. These forms will incorporate either one or both of the following variables into the Assessment template document: {{care_member_signature}}, {{supervisor_signature}}.  Security Policies will need to be updated to ensure that users can sign notes. 
To use, open the assessment PDF in Care, click on "Sign," add the signature, and then click "Save" to complete the process.
Please note that new document types will be automatically added the next time a Draft is created.


# Release notes: Version 2024.46.0

### Release Date: May 8, 2024 – 1:00 AM PST (tentative)

## New Functionality

- FT-622 - Calendar: working/availability hours per Encounter template
This feature caters to scenarios where users maintain varying availability for different Encounter types. For instance, users may take certain types of appointments only on specific days; or provide services onsite during designated hours. With this enhancement, users can now reflect their availability based on the type of Encounter.
When used, the New Encounter form in the Care Team Member drop down list will have a label appearing next to the users that are not available for a selected template, date, and time. This is similar to the one that currently appears in the case of non-working hours.  

- FT-691 - Connected Stripe accounts
If a customer uses Stripe for collecting patient payments and has separate Stripe accounts for different legal entities, Welkin can now support this scenario by linking connected Stripe accounts to a Master account. This is achievable in the Admin Portal by entering credentials from the Stripe account. Stripe accounts will be linked to a specific billing NPI, which will be incorporated into the attributes of the rendering provider in users' profiles to ensure payments are processed through the correct Stripe account.

# Release notes: Version 2024.45.0

### Release Date: Apr 23, 2024 – 1:00 AM PST (tentative)

## New Functionality

- CT-575 - E-Signing consent forms by patients
This functionality enhances the management of consent forms for patients by introducing a new entity, "Consent," into the Forms section of the Designer portal. This allows for the uploading of a Consent Form template, which can then be sent to patients for e-signature. Patients are required to review the document, create a signature, and e-sign the document, which will subsequently be added to the patient's Document Center. 
A second phase where users in the Care portal can add e-signatures to assessments, enabling them to lock and sign assessment notes, is currently being developed by the engineering team. 

- FT-685 -  External profiles: Medi-Span
A new attribute called "Type" has been added to the Profiles entity in Welkin. Profile types include “Internal” and “External.”  All existing Profiles will be classified as Internal because they are managed, added, or modified in the Care Portal. External-type Profiles will be utilized when the source of Profile values is external or involves large data volumes such as data dictionaries.
The first dictionary connected to Welkin is Medi-Span. Please note that a license with Medi-Span is required to use this feature in Welkin. If you need Medi-Span or other dictionaries added to Welkin, please contact the Welkin Account Management team or enter a Work Request ticket.

- FT-691 - Connected Stripe accounts
If a customer uses Stripe for collecting patient payments and has separate Stripe accounts for different legal entities, Welkin can now support this scenario by linking connected Stripe accounts to a Master account. This is achievable in the Admin Portal by entering credentials from the Stripe account. Stripe accounts will be linked to a specific billing NPI, which will be incorporated into the attributes of the rendering provider in users' profiles to ensure payments are processed through the correct Stripe account.

- FT-808 -  Replace "NA" with "-" in PDF templates
This task modifies how variables with empty values are displayed in the PDF template output, changing from "NA" (not answered) to "-", to improve the patient experience.



## Improvements and Bug Fixes

- FT-790 - Variable fonts from docx templates in assessments PDFs
This update corrects the interpretation of DOCX templates and improves the rendering of text styles(in particular bold, italics) in Assessment PDFs.

- FT-791 -  Running title syntax specifics in DOCX templates and related PDF markup issues
This update enhances the interpretation of running titles in DOCX templates. Due to inconsistencies in the XML structure produced by different versions of MS Word, special guidelines will be issued on how to structure running titles to avoid layout issues in the PDF output. 

- FT-796 (WS-3592) - UX improvement for Data Views "Add Form" with linked Profile record field
This update enhances the behavior of the "Add Form" in Data Views, particularly when containing CDT fields linked with Profile records. Previously, when adding a new Profile record within the "Add Form," the data entered into the fields would not be preserved. With this improvement, the data entered into the fields prior to adding a new Profile record is now preserved, ensuring a smoother and more user-friendly experience.





# Release notes: Version 2024.44.0

### Release Date: Apr 8, 2024 – 1:00 AM PST (tentative)

## New Functionality

- FT-620, FT-621 - Calendar: Time Zones switching and display functionality
This feature allows users to control updating their own time zone within the Calendar to impersonate the view of other users. Viewing other time zones is useful for customers with patients or a presence in two or more time zones. 
Users involved in scheduling for other care team members can now view time zones in the calendar as seen by users in different time zones. This capability is also convenient when arranging Encounter times with a patient on the phone. 
Time Zone switching is optional, and can be enabled at the individual level in the User Profile view in Care.

- FT-739 - Update UI of clickable area in profile records in Data Views
This update enhances the behavior of the web links displayed in data views, letting links navigate to the web page the links point to. The behavior when clicking on the other values remains unchanged, navigating to the profile screen.

- FT-34 - CDT Arrays: CDT Arrays allow for the selection of multiple options within one assessment question or data view.  Previously, when creating a CDT linking a Profile with a Patient, users were limited to establishing one-to-one relationships. This restriction meant that, for example, if a Profile used ICD-10 as the answer option source for a diagnosis question in an assessment, users could only select a single option.

## New Functionality
- WEL-7223: Enhanced User Experience for Accessing Welkin Resources. An improvement has been made to the system's behavior when users attempt to access Welkin resources, such as opening links to assessments, without authentication. Previously, users encountered an error message stating "This page can't be found" and were redirected to the home page after logging in. However, with the latest release, the system now verifies the user's authentication status and access rights before proceeding. If the user is not authenticated, they will be presented with a login screen. After successful login, they will be directed to the intended page associated with the accessed link.
- WEL-7385: Seeing and Copying Long Titles in List Field. In certain scenarios, long titles in list fields were being truncated due to their excessive length, making it impossible to view the complete content.

This functionality applies to both the Care and Designer portals, providing an improved user experience.



## Improvements and bug fixes
- WEL-6927 (WS-2386): Handling of Null Values in the Designer Configurations. Previously, an error was displayed when working with configurations in the Designer, specifically when encountering config files containing null values. The system now accepts null values so that errors will not be displayed when one is present within the configuration. 
- WEL-7319 (WS-2652): Improved Display of "Not Set" Option for List-Radio Type in Assessments. In the past, there was an issue where the "Not Set" option would be displayed for the list-radio type in assessments, even when it was not configured in the Designer. Now, for required fields, the "Not Set" option will no longer be displayed. However, for optional fields, the 'Not Set' option will still be available. This allows users the flexibility to choose "Not Set" in case they accidentally select an option and wish to reset it.
- WEL-7498 (WS-2721): Inaccurate "Completed By" value for Reassigned Assessments. Previously, the "Completed By" field would inaccurately display the name of the user who reassigned an assessment to another Encounter, even though they were not the actual completer of the assessment. This behavior has been addressed. The system now accurately displays the name of the user who completed the assessment, ensuring that the "Completed By" field reflects the correct completer's name.
- WEL-7467 (WS-2721): Fix for assessment completed day in the drawer. Previously, the assessment drawer displayed the updated date instead of the completed date. The correct assessment completion date is now displayed in the drawer.

# Release notes: Version 2023.24.1

Additionally, files can be viewed in full-screen mode and easily downloaded and opened in a new tab. For comprehensive guidance on utilizing the API, the Postman public collection will be updated with the latest information.
Please be aware that the successful sharing of media files relies on ensuring compatibility with the recipients' application, as it should support the specific media file formats being transmitted.



## Improvements and bug fixes
- WEL-7432 - Auto-assigning unrecognized communication. We have made enhancements to the logic of the Default assignee field.

#Release notes: Version 2023.23.1**

### Release Date:  Jun 19, 2023 – 1:00 AM PST (tentative)

## New Functionality
- WEL-6786 - Auto-assign for Unrecognized Communications: In certain cases, there may be multiple patients, patient-related contacts, or a combination of both, who share the same phone number or email in the profile. When a new SMS, email or a call arrives from such a number, it is directed to the Unrecognized Communications section. During an active text message exchange, the user needs to navigate to this section every time to assign the SMS to the appropriate patient. To streamline this process, we are introducing an auto-assign feature. This feature allows you to choose a patient or patient related contact as the default assignee when assigning a message or call to a patient. Once set, the system will automatically route incoming communications to the assigned patient's Communication Center until a different default assignee is specified or the default assignee is removed. 
Please note that the Default assignee field will only be displayed if there are duplicate email or phone numbers in the system.
- WEL-7247 - From Number Configuration for SMS automations: We have introduced a new feature that allows users to specify the sending phone number, thereby improving SMS-related automations and creation of draft SMS for customers who utilize multiple phone numbers. 
A new section called Phone Names has been added in the Designer Portal, it allows you to create names for phones, which can be referenced during automation configuration. To associate names with phone numbers, you will need to indicate the correspondence between the phone and the name within the Admin Portal's Integrations tab, specifically the Communication page. If a name is specified in an automation but no phone is associated with that name, the automation will not be executed, and this can be tracked in the automation logs.
The assigned phone names will also be displayed in the Care Portal's Communication Center, specifically in the "From" field. Additionally, you can find these phone names in the Designer Portal's Phone Trees page.
It is possible to leave the "From" number empty in automation. In this case, the system will behave as it does currently and use the phone number marked as "Main" in the admin settings.
Please note that the phone number selected for the automation will take precedence over a phone number set as default on a patient profile. In other words, if you have configured a default number for a patient, it will only be utilized if no specific phone number is chosen for the automation.
At present, certain phones are already assigned names through Welkin's internal admin system, managed by our support department. However, our future plans involve phasing out these names and exclusively showcasing the phone names established within the Designer Portal. This modification will grant you, as our client, the ability to independently manage the names instead of relying on support. We kindly request you to replace the existing labels by generating your own within the upcoming two weeks, preferably before July 3rd.
Currently, some phones already have names assigned through Welkin's internal admin system, managed by our support department. However, we plan to decomision these names in the future and display only the phone names set within the Designer Portal. This change will allow you, as our client, to manage the names yourself instead of relying on support. We kindly request that you replace existing labels by creating your own within the next two weeks, preferably by July 3rd.

Additionally, the sender's First and Last Name are now shown for messages, with the label "Patient" assigned specifically to patient messages.
- WEL-5741 - Open Profiles APIs for external users. Profiles in Welkin are “generic” objects that can represent individuals as well as non-person lists such as ICD-10, CPT codes, family members, doctors, and non-Welkin care staff, etc. Profiles are backed by CDT's, so it’s possible to customize them. With this release, we're enabling the ability to interact with Profiles (including actions like get, create, and update) through our API.

# Release notes: Version 2023.21.1

### Release Date:  May 22, 2023 – 1:00 AM PST (tentative)

## New Functionality
- WEL-6412 Communication with patient representatives. This feature is designed to empower customers in facilitating communication between their users and third-party entities associated with patients, such as legal guardians, providers, and relatives. It utilizes the comm center as a means of communication.
According to Welkin's design, these entities should be stored within profiles. To make a profile record contactable, two requirements must be met: 1) it should be linked / added as a contact to a patient, and 2) it should belong to a profile with the "contactable" switch enabled in the Designer, which is introduced as part of the current feature.
Once these conditions are fulfilled, communication icons will appear next to phone numbers and emails on the profile record within a patient's screen. Care users have the freedom to click on these icons to initiate communication with the relevant entities. Clicking on an icon will redirect the user to the comm center, where all standard features, including making and receiving calls, sending SMS, and emails, are available. Detailed instructions will be provided shortly.
- WEL-7102 (WS-2528) - Ability to copy the link to the assessment. In the assessment drawer, a sharing function has been added, featuring an icon located at the top right corner. By clicking on this icon, users can easily copy the link to the specific assessment. Regardless of whether the link was copied within the context of an encounter, it will consistently direct the recipient to the assessments page. It is important to note that the link to the assessment will only be accessible for viewing if the user has the necessary rights to view that particular assessment. Furthermore, the link contains an assessment ID, which helps identify and access the assessment accurately.
- WEL-7135 - Add Mandarin language. With the release, Mandarin has been added as a language option to the user and patient profiles. 
- CT-11 - Exporting Chat and WhatsApp Messages Using the Export API. With the latest release, users now have the ability to export chat logs through the Export API. Additionally, these exported logs can be uploaded to an S3 Bucket for further analysis and utilization in Sisense. Please keep in mind that in order to export the data, it is necessary to enable the CHAT and WHATS_APP policies in the Export Data section of the Security Policy page in the Designer.


## Improvements and bug fixes
- WEL-7055 (WS-2496, WS-2537) - Clicking to encounters page after using new "assign to encounter" feature filters encounter list to in-progress only. Fixed incorrect behavior of filters when assigning an assessment to an encounter.
- WEL-7105 - To improve the readability of the label for phones, the location of the From and To fields in the SMS and Call drawers has been changed. Now the fields are located under each other so that users can see most of the phone’s label.
- WEL-7061 -  “Select All” option for Territories field in API client configuration. An option to “Select All” has been added when editing “Accesses, Policies, Roles, Territories” for API clients in the Admin portal.

- WEL-7069 (WS-2503) - Not able to send chat if not in the care team. Fixed an issue with security policies for Live Chat where a user with access could not write a message in the chat.


# Release notes: Version 2023.19.1

### Release Date:  April 26, 2023 – 1:00 AM PST (tentative)

## New Functionality
- WEL-6878, WEL-6879 - Assign and remove assessments to/from an encounter. You can assign an assessment to an encounter by clicking the "Assign to Encounter" button in the assessment drawer if the drawer is opened from the assessments page. Please note that it is only possible to assign an assessment to an encounter if it has not already been associated with another encounter. To remove an assessment from an encounter, simply click on the "..." icon next to the assessment you wish to remove in the corresponding encounter, and then select the "Remove (Unassign)" button. If you need to link the removed assessment to an encounter again, you can do so using the assign functionality.
- WEL-6875 (WS-2197) - Notification grouping improvement. In this release, we have made an improvement to the notifications block by grouping notifications based solely on their date rather than both date and time as was done previously. Additionally, to improve user experience, we have included a sticky date that will remain visible when scrolling through the notifications. This enhancement makes it easier for users to quickly identify and navigate through their notifications.
- WEL-6936 (WS-2064) - Display the number of unread notifications on the notification bell. We have made an update to the Care portal's notification bell with this release. Instead of the previous red dot indicating the presence of unread notifications, the notification bell now displays the actual number of unread messages. If the number of unread messages exceeds 99, the notification bell will show "99+" to indicate that there are more than 99 unread notifications. This enhancement provides users with a more accurate and informative representation of their unread notifications.
- WEL-6921 (WS-2262) - Change to Read All button behavior in the Notifications drawer. In the notification block of the Care portal, we have made a change to the behavior of the Read All button. Previously, the button was hidden if there were no unread messages in the list. However, with our latest update, the Read All button will now remain in place but become inactive when there are no unread messages to read. This change allows for consistency in the placement of the Archive All button, which will replace the Read All button when users have unread notifications.
- WEL-6876 (WS-2189) - Enhanced Validation for empty required fields in PFAs. We have enhanced the functionality of the system when working with PFAs. If a required field is left empty, clicking the Next or Complete button will now prompt the system to scroll to the empty field and display a validation message indicating that the field must be filled out before proceeding. This improvement ensures that users are notified of any missing required fields and helps to streamline the process of filling out PFAs.

## Improvements and bug fixes
- WEL-6874 (WS-2336) - Fix of Patient contains non-existent territories error due to extra space in name. Previously, the system was displaying an error message indicating that the patient contains non-existent territories due to extra spaces in the territory names. This error occurred when there were unnecessary spaces at the beginning or end of a territory or region name. To address this issue, we have implemented a fix that will remove any unneeded spaces in the names of the objects at both the start and end, thus preventing this error from happening again.
- WEL-6932 (WS-2371) - Graph Not Updating Correctly When Changing Date Range Manually. Previously, users encountered an issue where the graph would not update properly after manually changing the date range (i.e. entering dates instead of selecting from the dropdown options) for a second time. Specifically, the graph would only reflect the changes made during the first manual update. With our latest release, we have resolved this issue and the graph will now accurately update with any subsequent manual changes to the date range.
- WEL-6961 (WS-2376) -Issues with recording phone calls. We resolved an issue where calls were not being recorded correctly due to double recording. There are two webhooks for call recording: one for the call made to the user (child call) and another one for when the user hung up while the patient was still on the call. In some instances, the second webhook would overwrite the first one. This second webhook was commonly used when all users were busy and no one picked up the call. With our fix, this issue has been addressed and calls will now be recorded properly.

If neither the user nor the patient has a time zone specified in their profile, then UTC is used. For the Date field, it is dependent on the time zone of the user filling it in. In the case of PFAs, the date value is recorded when the link is sent, taking into account the user's time zone. If a time zone is not set in the user’s profile, then UTC is used. When submitting a PFA through an automation, the UTC value is used.

# Release notes: Version 2022.7.2.2

### Date : July 29th, 2022

## This is a hotfix release and it addresses critical bugs in encounters, policies & assessments.


## Care
- WEL-5558	Unable to restrict date changes to Encounters. Removing the "update" permission in Designer still allowed a user to click on an Encounter link and edit. This has been resolved, so the update permission is now required to make any changes to date/time of encounter.
- WEL-5536 	Changing the primary team contact throws a 500 error. Primary contact can now be changed without issue. 
- WEL-5555	Unable to delete patients.  Errors were generated when attempting to delete patients, preventing patient deletion.  Resolved.
- WEL-5559	User license field does not reliably persist data.  Accessing the user license field sometimes did not display the information.  Resolved.
- WEL-5535	Encounter disposition pre-defined fields throws a 500 error. The error is no longer displayed when working with Encounter Depositions with pre-filled fields.
- WEL-5562	Disable 'Add' button for assessments if the ‘’Update’’ policy is not set.  Update is required to be enabled for a user to add an assessment.


## Designer
- WEL-5534	Create encounter permissions required to add a note to an existing encounter. 
We have moved the ability to add a new assessment to an encounter from 'Create' to 'Update' policy. If the 'Update' policy is not selected - a user will see disabled '+' button for adding new assessments. If the 'Update' policy is selected - a user will have the ability to add a new assessment to an encounter.
- WEL-5557	Toggling encounters into planned status tied to create settings. 
We have separated the 'Create' policy to two policies: 'Create encounter' and 'Move to Planned'. It allows the ability to create encounters, but blocks an ability to move an encounter from any status to 'Planned' back and vice versa.

With this change, we will make a migration to keep policies which have been set previously. If encounter permissions had the 'Create' policy, we have migrated it to 'Create encounter' and 'Move to Planned’ policy. If encounter had no 'Create' policy we have not selected 'Create encounter' or 'Move to Planned' policies.  Please update your permissions post release as appropriate.


## APIs
- WEL-5545	Encounters - Unable to restrict date changes to EncountersAPI
Separated CREATE permissions into two permissions: create encounter and change encounter status to PLANNED.  Please update your API permissions in Designer post release as appropriate.

Each Assessment within the folder, can support multiple statuses, to reflect better patient interactions. Statuses are visible in Care 
on the patient assessment layout:

1. New - indicates that assessment has been sent but the patient hasn't answered any questions yet
2. In Progress - indicates that patient has started working on assessment but hasn't completed it yet (same state as previously existed)
3. Submitted - indicates that patient has completed working on assessment
4. Expired - this is a special status, indicating that assessment link has expired and cannot be worked on by the patient anymore
5. Completed - this is the final state, no more changes are possible at this point (same state as previously existed)

What is the difference between Submitted and Completed?

When assessment is in status Submitted, it allows one that has enough permissions to review and Complete it. It is useful to do so
when a patient doesn't answer questions, or wants to change the answers while talking to a Welkin user.

Completed on the other hand, is a final state that triggers copy to custom data types associated with the assessment

Branding:

PFA folder now supports branding. In the Designer, our users can customize color scheme, logo, and favicon. The goal is to 
allow our customers to modify PFA to look and feel in native colors vs welkin color scheme

In addition, customers can use Welcome and Conclusion pages (optionally) for providing patients with additional instructions and
thank you notes, or extra customization for other needs

In the subsequent releases, we will include several UI/UX improvements, updates to Security Policies on Assessments and automation improvements

**Custom Patient Profile WEL-5032**

This release contains a fundamental improvement for Patient Profile. Our customers can now add fields directly to patients
in addition to existing methods of adding fields to the CDT. 

In addition, Top Info section has more configuration options and changed behavior, by allowing you to specify number of visible fields 
vs showing everything

The benefits of choosing this modeling tactics, will allow customers to define their Patient Create / Edit screens in addition to 
defining Patient List columns (to be released soon).

Of course, similarly to our previous recommendations, we suggest discussing modeling with Welkin Implementation team, since its typically
affecting how your API and Data will work and will look like



**International DateTime - WEL-5051**

In order to better support datetime across time zones (and in support of our international customers) the team developed datetime component that operates
based on the user locale. Locale can be set up in Admin or Care, and will dictate how date and time are displayed

**International Phone Number - WEL-5052**

In this release, Welkin has started adding support for international phone numbers. Customers can start adding phone numbers for patients outside the US

This is an opportunistic feature, meaning that we add support to a new country by requests and as of today, only the USA and Singapore were added to the support list. 
Please let us know if more countries are needed


**Designer JSON Viewer - WEL-5205**

To improve performance and memory footprint of designer, we had to make some modifications to JSON viewerL

1. The viewer is hidden by default and presents itself on a button click (CDT View, top right)
2. Viewer is read only and does not refresh automatically - a button is added for that

We resolved the limitation of List field (changing order of values in a list field, that previously was only possible to do in the JSON viewer)
and it's now possible to do that in our UI

Note: The future of JSON viewer depends on our customers, if that feature is something that you like, please let us know.

**Notification UX - WEL-4332**

We implemented changes to Notification UX (drawer) in Care, to support archiving of one notification at a time (vs bulk).
This means that single archive button will only archive one notification and archive all will act on all
The option of "archive all older than current" that previously existed, was now removed

**International - WhatsApp support - WEL-4814**

To support our International customers, we have added support to whatsapp. Customers can start WhatsApp conversations, send 
and receive messages, attachments and use templates 


Note: This feature requires configuration on Welkin side and not available out of the box to anyone, due to nature of such chat integration
If you are interested in trying it out and eligible from compliance perspective, please reach out to your CSM

**Phone Capabilities - WEL-5071**

Each phone number in Welkin, has a list of associated capabilities. Using that list, customers can tag a phone number (Voice, SMS, MMS). Once tagged,
Comm Center will help users understand that SMS cannot be sent to a number that does not have such capability for example, and will help our customers
to increase success rate of different communication channels

Note: Some UX changes and improvements to Comm Center, are going to be released in next releases

**Automation - WEL-5134**

Two improvements in this release:
1. Encounter creation action now includes ability to specify Care team (Point of Contact or Role) to better target correct audience
2. New Condition on Patient to test for Care Team (or Point of Contact) - to help identify situations when patients have no active care team members
or point of contact

In order to help our customers onboard users programatically, we are making user provision api available to api clients.

the route that the call has taken and steps performed, to help understand why phone calls arrive to certain users instead of other users

opt in/out users from participating in a phone tree for any reason

# Release notes - Version 2022.3.6

### Date: March 25, 2022

## New Features Callout

**New Tasks Layout and Updates to Task List - WEL-4579**

In this release, we upgraded Tasks functionality to support new use cases and new UI. 
1. A new default Task layout is now available in Designer. Customers can add Tasks to patient view, 
similar to other default layouts. This layout will offer a filtered version to all tasks for this patient and filter capabilities, by Assignee, Dates and other fields
2. New filters are introduced, including ability to filter tasks by certain template (or by Custom Task)
3. User tasks view will now offer a view to see tasks of any users, with a preset default to the current logged in User. It will allow one 
to locate tasks for assignees that may no longer be with the company or need help reassigning the tasks
4. Convenient "Clear All" button removes all filters
5. Sorting by clicking on column name in the Task List is now available. The sort will perform a sort within each section (Todo, In Progress and Completed),
and will allow users to see each section independently without intermixing different statuses

Updates to Task drawer

6. UI changes - added Updated by field and moved both Created and Updated fields to the top of the drawer
7. When a new task is created without a patient, updating it from the drawer will allow one to assign 
the patient. Similar to the past behavior, once patient is assigned, they cannot be changed
8. "Save & Clone" button has been added to replace the checkbox. Convenient for customers who create many tasks for different patient at the same time.
The behavior was updated as well, clicking on Save & Clone will preserve all data in the tasks, besides a Patient and Comments, allow fast creation of 
similar tasks for all the patients


**Automation - New Triggers, Conditions - WEL-4579**

This release contains a new batch of different automation triggers and conditions, allowing our customers to automate even more use cases

New Triggers
1. Task is completed (new set of all triggers for tasks is available, to represent each state)
2. Point of contact changed
3. Care Team updated
4. Encounter Updated 

New Conditions:

5. On SMS receive, perform a text match (case sensitive and insensitive options are available)
6. Condition to check if patient is in Territory or Region
7. Condition to check for Text and Text Area fields being Null or NotNull

Couple of sample use cases that can be used by our customers:
1. On sms receive, look up for keyword and generate task, notification or email to the user to take some action
2. On task complete (of certain template) generate a new task (of a different template) - allows one to chain tasks, one after another
3. When executing some action, customers can check if a patient is in a certain Territory or in certain Program, allowing applying a different types of automation 
from the same trigger based on different location of program assignment


**Change User's Email - WEL-4710**

This is to address one of the customer's requests to change the user's email address. Once email address is updated, the system will send notification to
the old email address (informing of update), trigger password reset to the new address and inform tenant owner of such a change

**Terminology Panel - WEL-4417**

With this release, we start allowing our customers to modify some core concepts in Welkin UI, to match customers own terminology.
The most popular use case, about 50% or our customers do not actually use the word Patient, but something else.
With the release, the word patient can be replaced with a different term.
To use that feature, override default terminology in Designer (or create a brand new one) and have users use it, from their Profile page by choosing display language

Note: This is an experimental feature, completely based on our customers requests, currently in Alpha. 
Please reach out with any feedback or wish list about this feature. We will only know how well it fits your need based on the feedback

**Webhook Management**

In order to improve Webhook management a bit, we are splitting webhook functionality into two different areas.
1. Webhooks are still created in the designer, however one can only provide name and title
2. Once deployed, webhooks can be found in Admin under Integrations -> Webhooks.

The webhooks in Admin would be Inactive by default, and would have to be supplied with URL (other parameters can be added as well) before activation

Note: Designer UI has been disabled and to provide these values, is now read only, and all current values have been migrated. 
In the next releases, we will clean up the designer UI as well


**Granular Email Status - WEL-4424**

In this release, we added a new feature that will propagate detail email status back to Care

New email statuses will support, Opened, Clicked and Failed.

There are some restrictions on how Opened and Clicked can work, depending on the end user(patient) email server (can be fully blocked), specific user setup
and the sender domain,but in general, if the email was Opened by the patient the status will become Open, if the email contains a link and the link was clicked, 
the status will be Clicked, and Failure will be presented if we cannot deliver the email.
Combined, under reasonable circumstances, should provide our customers with enough visibility into each and every email that is being sent from Welkin


**Profiles - New Data View structures - WEL-4357**

With the Profiles features being heavily used in Welkin, we have updated Data Views in the designer, to support profiles but also offer more reach 
functionality.
Generally speaking, fields can be placed in different layouts in in different rows, they can be combined to show one or more profile fields and will allow
profiles to be hyperlinked from the CDT view.
The UX in designer was completely updated not only to support this functionality but also to comply with our latest styling guide

# Release notes - Version 2022.2.5

### Date: February 23, 2022

## New Features Callout

**Patient List: WEL-3630**

Patients view has been updated to better UX experience. Filters, columns are now aligned to the new mockups and new structure of UX
Search, filters have new UX control, defaults to current logged in member
This is a first update to patients list, in the next releases we will be introducing a new My Patients view, that is tailored for Care team members
with a predefined filter set

**Configurable Patient View: WEL-4344**

With this release, Patient View (on a patient profile, above Action Bar) is now a configurable feature.

Navigate to the Top Info menu in the Designer, pick and choose what fields are visible. Note: All the fields would be available in the profile
however non visible fields would be hidden under "More Info"

**Automation Targets: WEL-4221**

Two new features
1. In this release, we allow automation to go beyond the care team, to "All users with role". This automation, allows for cross functional workflow, that can
unlock new organizational processes.
For example, one can create automation with a trigger on Assessment Completed and route notification to a role "Scheduling Assistant" that is not necessarily
present on the care team
2. Automation triggers now offer more details, by allowing one to use Phase Started and Phase Ended events. This offers more granularity in configuring 
different use cases that need to happen when a patient enters a phase and a patient exists a phase.
Good example is to send a Welcome email when a patient entered the Eligible phase in a program, or Congratulations SMS when a Patient has completed Graduated phase.


## Care
- WEL-4545 Fixed: Comm Center: Send a draft: After sending an email, 5xx error would be presented and email remains in draft, despite being sent
- WEL-4522 Fixed: Patient facing assessment on a mobile device is not optimal for scrollers
- WEL-4521 Fixed: Assessment input error on mobile with Date CDT types
- WEL-4217 Fixed: Relationship therapy throws 5xx error under specific load type
- WEL-4481 Fixed: Encounters -> Create an encounter :Search does not bring a full list of patients, despite them being in the right territory
- WEL-3829 Fixed: Removing attachments and resaving drafts strips out HTML format
- WEL-4230 Fixed: In some cases, assessment API would store phone and date in invalid format (as formatted text vs spec). That is now fixed
- WEL-4388 Fixed: Comm Center -> If the patient primary email/phone is missing and only secondary email/phone is configured, emails/sms are not sent
- WEL-4377 Fixed: My Calendar: View an encounter: Incorrect event icon is used for different delivery types
- WEL-4319 Fixed: Outdated cache is causing issues viewing clients' Assessments tabs
- WEL-4379 Updated: Comm Center: UX and layout issues to improve the experience
- WEL-4150 Updated: Patient facing assessments now support profile links
- WEL-4433 Updated: Task List: Created By column will now display a name of automation disposition group, if task is created by one
- WEL-4434 Updated: When Automation Task is created, the "initials icon" is misleading
- WEL-4207 Updated: Display of Encounter date date/time in message templates. Previously used ISO format is now updated to human readable. More improvements to be done in that area in the future, to support both formats as variables
- WEL-4080 Updated: Better error handling of Docusign errors. Propagating Docusign error codes to Welkin to produce more meaningful indication of what went wrong


## Designer
- WEL-4401 Fixed: Labels on Program Phases on the relations are not deletable
- WEL-4400 Fixed: Numbers in change summary are not aligned correctly, for any 3 digit revision
- WEL-3962 Fixed: Version history : Diff : Improved performance of a diff element 
- WEL-4385 Fixed: Custom Notifications: Title of the action group is now used as title of notification and automation. Appropriate tool tip has been added
- WEL-4219 Fixed: Email templates do match what is created in Designer. When rich text is being copied to designer rich text editor, it is now stripped 
of custom fonts, and needs to be styled in place. That removes a friction of custom font that is not installed on recipient machine and changes the 
look and feel of an email
- WEL-4519 Updated: Terminology and labels in Automation were updated, new UI hints are added to improve readability of different actions and targets
- WEL-4431 Updated: UI tooltip on using form fields vs external to the form cdt fields with instructions

## Admin
- WEL-4288 New: Filter Inactive Users: allow filtering based of User Status (Active, Inactive)

## Known Issues
1. Automation: When using Task or Notification as an action, and selecting a specific Role, the first user in that role in a care team is being chosen for assignment,
contrary to the original intent, of selecting a random user in that role
2. Automation Target: Triggering an event on a patient without a care team is failing. It going to be fixed in a next release
3. Patient List: minor UX issues 
4. Patient Top Info: minor UX issues

## Deprecation Notice
To simplify automation, we removed "Encounter Deposition Created Event" as a trigger in Automation, since its a single record CDT and that event is managed by the system

## Special Note
With the upcoming release, we are making a non-impactful change to use a dedicated webhook per tenant/environment, for the comm center.
The change will make it easier for us to monitor failures and introducing a prep infra to consume new events (clicked and delivered) for email messages



# Release notes - Version 2022.2.1

### Date: February 4, 2022

New functionality is added to conditions on assessments. Our customers can now set visibility on forms using values from arbitrary CDT.

# Release notes - Version 2021.11.5

### Date: November 05, 2021

## New Features Callout

### New Encounters and Calendars UI

This feature is a result of customer feedback that we recieved over last quarter. It features a redesigned Encounters UI, Events UI, API, filters and other 
capabilities.

Some of the new capabilities include:
- Synchronization of calendar events and encounters, allowing seemless integration between the two
- Different types of events for leave and team meetings vs encounters, including all day events
- Redesigned and improved UI
- Ability to schedule events and encounters for other users
- Improved filters and search
- Persisted history of all the changes to ensure accurate data representation with improved audit log
- Improved navigation between calendar and encounter


### Profiles
In the new release, Welkin supports a concept of Profile. Profile is a new core entity, that can be defined and configured in the designer and can be used
to relate to patients. Typical use cases of profiles include representation of Family Members, Hospitals, Physicians that provide support to the patients but 
not necessarily have direct access to Welkin platform.

With this powerfull features, customers can manage multiple lists of profiles, associate profile records with patients (using our flexieble CDT model) and fully customize the experience

Profile records can participate in the Assessments as well, as a response to a question. 
As usual, profiles will require a security policy configuration

This is the first release of Profiles and there would be subsequent releases with enhaced functionalities in the near future

### Assessments: Using conditions to hide and show required questions 

Welkin Platform offers two levels of required fields. CDT level will ensure data consistency and is enforced through the API. Another level
is an assessment level. With that feature release, required questions can be validated in the UI on the assessment level, and as a result can participate in 
conditional show/hide functionality. In order for the feature to function properly, the underlying CDT cannot have required fields and the validation will only work in
the assessments user interface
- WEL-3693 
- WEL-3516 
- WEL-3514 

### Assessments: Using CDT variables in the assessments questions.

This feature allows one to use values from a CDT in order to form questions in the Assessments. 
Using Welkin variable builder, one can refer to values previously
collected in order to present dynamically created question. 
Welkin will also persist the questions with resolved values (values to the moment of finalized questions) in order
to maintain integrity for presentation of the values over time
- WEL-3362 
- WEL-3359 
- WEL-3358 
- WEL-3357 
- WEL-3360 

### Assessments: Addition of Contains operator 

This feature enhances Welkin's list of supported operators, and allows one to use Contains for multi select lists for condition evaluation in the assessments
